# Admin Dashboard

Welcome to the [**Admin Dashboard**](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-admin-dashboard) project! üéâ

This is a sleek and responsive dashboard built with nothing but good ol' **HTML** and **CSS**. It's part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum, where the goal was to create a stylish admin interface that looks great and is mainly done with grid.
